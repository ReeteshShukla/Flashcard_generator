Machine Learning is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It allows computers to make predictions or decisions based on data.

There are three primary types of Machine Learning:

1. Supervised Learning – Uses labeled datasets. Algorithms learn to predict output from input data. Examples: Linear Regression, Decision Trees.
2. Unsupervised Learning – Uses unlabeled data to find hidden patterns. Examples: K-means Clustering, PCA.
3. Reinforcement Learning – An agent learns by interacting with the environment and receiving rewards or penalties. Example: Q-learning.

Common applications of Machine Learning include spam filtering, recommendation systems, fraud detection, and autonomous vehicles.

Overfitting is a common challenge where a model performs well on training data but poorly on new data. Underfitting happens when a model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns.

Popular ML libraries include Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch. Data preprocessing, model evaluation, and feature selection are key steps in any ML project.

Ethical concerns in Machine Learning include bias in training data, privacy concerns, and explainability of model decisions.
